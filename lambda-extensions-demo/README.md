# Lambda Extensions Demo

This is a demo of the logging functionality available with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) Extensions to send logs directly from Lambda to [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

For more information on the extensions logs functionality, see the blog post [Using AWS Lambda extensions to send logs to custom destinations](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-aws-lambda-extensions-to-send-logs-to-custom-destinations/)

# Reference Architecture Diagram

This example packages the extension and function as zip archives. See the s3-logs-extension-demo-container-image version to use the functionality with container images.

> This is a simple example extension to help you start investigating the Lambda Runtime Logs API. This code is not production ready, and it has never intended to be. Use it with your own discretion after testing thoroughly.  

The demo includes a Lambda function with an extension delivered as a Lambda Layer.

The extension uses the Extensions API to register for INVOKE and SHUTDOWN events. The extension, using the Logs API, then subscribes to receive platform and function logs, but not extension logs. The extension runs a local HTTP endpoint listening for HTTP POST events. Lambda delivers log batches to this endpoint. The code can be amended (see the comments) to handle each log record in the batch. This can be used to process, filter, and route individual log records to any preferred destination

The example creates an S3 bucket to store the logs. A Lambda function is configured with an environment variable to specify the S3 bucket name. Lambda streams the logs to the extension. The extension copies the logs to the S3 bucket.

The extension uses the Python runtime from the execution environment to show the functionality. The recommended best practice is to compile your extension into an executable binary and not rely on the runtime.

The demo deploys all components together using the [AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

## Requirements

* [AWS SAM CLI ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) - **minimum version 0.48**.

## Installation instructions

1. [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and login.

2. Clone the repo onto your local development machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lambda-extensions
cd s3-logs-extension-demo-zip-archive
```

1. Run the following command for AWS SAM to deploy the components as specified in the `template.yml` file:
```bash
sam build
# If you receive build errors or don't have 'Python' or 'make' installed, you can use the option to build using a container which uses a python3.8 Docker container image.  
# sam build --use-container
sam deploy --stack-name s3-logs-extension-demo --guided
```

During the prompts:

* Accept the default Stack Name `s3-logs-extension-demo`.
* Enter your preferred Region
* Accept the defaults for the remaining questions.

AWS SAM deploys the application stack which includes the Lambda function and an IAM Role. AWS SAM creates a layer for the runtime, a layer for the extension, and adds them to the function.

Note the outputted S3 Bucket Name.

## Invoke the Lambda function
You can now invoke the Lambda function. Amend the Region and use the following command:
```bash
aws lambda invoke \
 --function-name "logs-extension-demo-function" \
 --payload '{"payload": "hello"}' /tmp/invoke-result \
 --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
 --log-type Tail \
 --region <use your Region>
```
The function should return `"StatusCode": 200`

Browse to the [Amazon CloudWatch Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch). Navigate to *Logs\Log Groups*. Select the log group **/aws/lambda/logs-extension-demo-function**.

View the log stream to see the platform, function, and extensions each logging while they are processing.

The logging extension also receives the log stream directly from Lambda, and copies the logs to S3.

Browse to the [Amazon S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/S3). Navigate to the S3 bucket created as part of the SAM deployment. 

Downloading the file object containing the copied log stream. The log contains the same platform and function logs, but not the extension logs, as specified during the subscription.

If you receive a `permission denied Extension.LaunchError` in the logs, the extension does not have the neccesary permissions.
Run `chmod +x logs_api_http_extension.py` and build and deploy the AWS SAM application again.
