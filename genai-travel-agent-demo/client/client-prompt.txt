I need a single page application written in HTML and JavaScript for a ChatBot application. These are the requirements...
1. It will be using WSS (websockets) to interact with the backend
2. To start the chat the user should be able to drag and drop an image
3. The image dropped should be displayed in the drop area
4. The user prompt will only be enabled after the image is sent to the backend and response received
5. The user can type a new message but not send it before receive a response to his previous message
6. While waiting for a response a processing message should be displayed
7. Don't use any JavaScript framework, only vanilla functions
